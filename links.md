2. [Linux Server Security: 10 Linux Hardening & Security Best Practices](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/08/linux-server-security-10-linux-hardening-security-best-practices/)
This article covers some of the linux scurity best practices. It helps me with my decision making in linux security.

3. [Encryption Methods in Linux](https://www.unixmen.com/encryption-methods-linux/)
This article explains the types of encryption in Linux. It helps me understand how linux encryption works.

4. [7 Useful Linux Security Features and Tools for Beginners](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-security-features-and-tools/)
This article provides an overview of some of the built-in security features in Linux. It also discusses how to use these tools to improve the security of your system.

## W03
1. [Linux FIle System](https://youtu.be/HbgzrKJvDRw)<br> 
This video explains what folders and directories exist in Linux and their uses. Of course it is useful to know the file system in Linux so that you can know which directory is used for a particular command.

2. [File System Commands](https://gist.github.com/khazeamo/f762f532bfbc17d5bf396e9d4c2a9586)<br>
This link contains the commands used to access and do something about the file system in Linux.

3. [File System Implementation](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskQvPDUk0sKgGGReUz7nMwYkDTbevUC1)<br>
This playlist will explain everything about file implementation in the operating system so that the process of the file system structure can be explored.

4. [Fragmentation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/fragmentation-in-operating-system)<br>
This link explains about one of the problems in the operating system that involves memory, namely fragmentation.

## W04
1. [Pointers in C](https://youtu.be/mw1qsMieK5c)<br> 
This video will explain how pointers work in the C programming language. This is useful for accessing the address of a variable.

2. [Paging in Operating System](https://youtu.be/pJ6qrCB8pDw)<br>
This video will explain one way of memory management in the operating system, namely paging. Of course this is useful for storing and retrieving data from secondary storage to main memory.

3. [Paging](https://kuleuven-diepenbeek.github.io/osc-course/ch9-memory/paging/)(Article)<br>
This link will provide an article containing details from the previous paging.

4. [Address Mapping](https://schoettkr.github.io/knowledge-database/uni/os/06_lecture/)<br>
This link will explain some of the variations of memory mapping that occur in operating systems. Of course this is related to the process of mapping logical addresses to physical address space.

## W05

1. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
An easy-to-understand explanation about virtual memory.

2. [Demand Paging in Operating Systems](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/what-is-demand-paging)<br>
This link helped me understand more about demand paging.

3. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
A simple explanation about page replacement algorithms

## W06

1. [Process](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/operating-system-processes#:~:text=The%20different%20Process%20States&text=READY%20%2D%20The%20process%20is%20waiting,The%20process%20has%20finished%20execution.)(Article)<br>
This link will provide an article that explains the various processes that occur when a program is executed. This is important because it is the fundamental basis of computing.

2. [Process State](https://youtu.be/jZ_6PXoaoxo)<br>
This video will explain the state of a process in an operating system program. This is because in a process, there can be more than one state that works simultaneously.

3. [Fork System Calls](https://youtu.be/IFEFVXvjiHY)<br>
This video will explain a system call to create a new process. The workings of creating a process certainly need to be understood to get through the basics of the program.

4. [Fork Visualization](https://youtu.be/QD9YKSg3wCc)<br>
Continuing from the previous video, this video will visualize how forks work to create a process. Of course, this relates to the relationship between the parent and child processes.

## W07

1. [Synchronization in Operating System](https://www.scaler.com/topics/operating-system/process-synchronization-in-os/)(Article)<br>
This article contains the basics of the synchronization process of a working operating system. This synchronization will then manage and help all applications run smoothly even when the operating system has to do many tasks simultaneously.

2. [Synchronization](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjDf_dmCEXgl6XjVKDDj0M2)(Video Playlist)<br>
This link contains videos that further explain the synchronization that occurs in an operating system. The process includes things that support a synchronization can run.

3. [Semaphore Example in C](https://youtu.be/ukM_zzrIeXs) 
This video will explain a variable of type number used to solve the critical section problem that uses two (atomic) operations namely wait and signal that will relate to operating system synchronization.

3. [Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.scaler.com/topics/operating-system/deadlock-in-os/)(Article)<br>
This article will explain the deadlock process in the operating system. This process aims to hold some resources that are used for other processes because these resources are also used by other processes.

4. [Deadlock](https://youtu.be/onkWXaXAgbY)(Video)<br>
This video will further explain the concept of deadlock. Of course, to help understand the process, this video has examples of using the concept of deadlock in the real world so that it can visualize the concept in the field of operating systems.
